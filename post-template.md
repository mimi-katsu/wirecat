    <p>Finaly got images working!! Next up is the thumbnails, but that should be pretty simple now. theres still some quirks in the error handling but nothing that effects operations thankfully. Now that that is figured out, theres 2 more things that need to get done before i can start making content. The first would be fixing the front page so that it shows a sensible mix of content and in a n organized fashion. Second would be to fix the css of the posts so that they are formatted nicely on upload. Almost there!
