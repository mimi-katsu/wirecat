    <p>It is with great pleasure I now inform you (myself) that uploads now work (kinda). I still need to mess with how the posts image paths are generated so that they are working (at all), but having functioning text upload is prrreeeeettty cool. Anyways, I hope I get that shit done soon so I can take a break from programming the site and just make content for it.</p>
